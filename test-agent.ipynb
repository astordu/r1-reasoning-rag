Maybe there's a typo here. But according to the given context, Jack is referred to as the husband. However, in reality, Sam Altman is known to have a brother named Jack Altman. The context might have an error here, but I have to go with the information provided. So according to the context, Jack is Sam's husband. But the question is about Sam Altman's brother's company.

Therefore, the brother's company isn't mentioned here. Wait, but maybe the user made a mistake, thinking Jack is the brother. But according to the given context, Jack is the husband.
